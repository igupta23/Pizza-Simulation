# pizza-simulation

This project uses a user interface on the command line. When the program is run, the available commands are displayed in a notice that describes how to run the commands. Fully capitalized words--DRIVER, TIME, INFO and TIP--entail user-defined values. The DRIVERs in the system are pre-determined. This means that only drivers in the system can be logged in, and these drivers can be found in the “drivers” command. The available drivers in this restaurant are Pam, Abe and Bob. The TIME must be entered in hh:mm military time format. For example 7:15 is an incorrect time entry since the appropriate 0 placeholder is missing (07:15). The INFO entered--the order--must describe the full order. The TIP must be entered as any integer.
